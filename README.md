Welcome to the IECSE Coding Bootcamp repository! The IECSE @MIT has developed this comprehensive learning resource. Our bootcamp is designed to provide a structured approach to mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms - skills that are essential for any aspiring software engineer. 

This repository contains materials covering key computer science concepts, including Stacks, Linked Lists, Binary Search, and more. Each module combines theoretical explanations with hands-on coding exercises, because we firmly believe that programming is best learned by doing.
