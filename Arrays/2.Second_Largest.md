# Given an array of integers, find the second largest element present in it.

## Brute force approach:

### Intuition
What do we do to find the largest element present in an array? We ideally sort them, and the last element would be the largest. Can we find the second-largest using a similar approach?

### Approach
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. The element present at the second index from the end is the second largest element.


```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;  // edge case when only one element is present in array
    sort(arr,arr+n);
    int large=arr[n-2];
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<large<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    int arr[]={1,2,4,6,7,5};
    int n=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    getElements(arr,n);
    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(N*logN)`

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Better approach:

### Intuition
Even though we want to have just the second largest element, we are still sorting the entire array for that and thus increasing the time complexity. Can we somehow try to not sort the array and still get our answer?

### Approach
1. Find the largest element in the array in a single traversal.
2. Traverse the array again to find the largest element that is just smaller than the largest element found earlier.
4. This element is the second largest element.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;  // edge case when only one element is present in array
    int large=INT_MIN,second_large=INT_MIN;
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        large=max(large,arr[i]);

    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        if(arr[i]>second_large && arr[i]!=large)
            second_large=arr[i];

    cout<<"Second largest is "<<second_large<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    int arr[]={1,2,4,6,7,5};
    int n=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    getElements(arr,n);
    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(N)`(Two traversals)

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Optimal approach:

### Intuition
In the previous solution, we were able to bring down the time complexity to **O(N)** but still required two traversals. Can we determine the second largest element in a single traversal using smart comparisons on the go?

### Approach
We need two variables: `large` and `second_large`.  
- Initialize `large` and `second_large` to **INT_MIN**.

### Algorithm:
1. If the current element is larger than `large`, update `second_large` to `large` and then update `large` to the current element.
2. Else if the current element is larger than `second_large` and not equal to `large`, update `second_large`.
3. After traversing the entire array, the variable `second_large` will hold the second largest element.

### Example Execution:

Given the array `{1, 2, 4, 7, 7, 5}`:

> **Iteration 1:** Current Element: `1`, Largest: `-2147483648`, Second Largest: `-2147483648`  
> `1` updates the largest to `1`.

> **Iteration 2:** Current Element: `2`, Largest: `1`, Second Largest: `-2147483648`  
> `2` updates the largest to `2`, second largest becomes `1`.

> **Iteration 3:** Current Element: `4`, Largest: `2`, Second Largest: `1`  
> `4` updates the largest to `4`, second largest becomes `2`.

> **Iteration 4:** Current Element: `7`, Largest: `4`, Second Largest: `2`  
> `7` updates the largest to `7`, second largest becomes `4`.

> **Iteration 5:** Current Element: `7`, Largest: `7`, Second Largest: `4`  
> No change as `7` is equal to the largest.

> **Iteration 6:** Current Element: `5`, Largest: `7`, Second Largest: `7`  
> No change as `5` is smaller than both.

```cpp
int secondLargest(int arr[],int n)
{
	if(n<2)
	return -1;
    int large=INT_MIN,second_large=INT_MIN;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    {
        if (arr[i] > large) 
        {
            second_large = large;
            large = arr[i];
        }
 
        else if (arr[i] > second_large && arr[i] != large) 
        {
            second_large = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return second_large;                
}

int main() {
    int arr[]={1,2,4,7,7,5};  
    int n=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
        int sL=secondLargest(arr,n);
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<sL<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
