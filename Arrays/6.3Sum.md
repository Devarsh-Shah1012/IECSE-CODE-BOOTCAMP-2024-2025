# Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique triplets that add up to give a sum of zero. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique triplets \[arr\[a\], arr\[b\], arr\[c\]\] such that i!=j, j!=k, k!=i, and their sum is equal to zero.

## Brute force approach:

### Intuition:

This approach is pretty straightforward. Here, we will check all possible triplets using 3 loops and among them, we will consider the ones whose sum is equal to the given target (i.e., 0). Before considering them as our answer, we need to sort the triplets in ascending order so that we can consider only the unique ones.

### Algorithm:

The steps are as follows:

1. **Declare a Set**:  
   First, we will declare a set data structure as we want unique triplets.

2. **First Loop (i)**:  
   Then, we will use the first loop (say `i`) that will run from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Second Loop (j)**:  
   Inside it, there will be the second loop (say `j`) that will run from `i+1` to `n-1`.

4. **Third Loop (k)**:  
   Then there will be the third loop (say `k`) that runs from `j+1` to `n-1`.

5. **Check the Sum**:  
   Now, inside these 3 nested loops, we will check the sum i.e. `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]`, and if it is equal to the target i.e. `0`, we will sort this triplet and insert it into the set data structure.

6. **Return the Result**:  
   Finally, we will return the list of triplets stored in the set data structure.


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> triplet(int n, vector<int> &arr) {
    set<vector<int>> st;

    // check all possible triplets:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++)
                if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == 0) {
                    vector<int> temp = {arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]};
                    sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
                    st.insert(temp);
                }

    //store the set elements in the answer:
    vector<vector<int>> ans(st.begin(), st.end());
    return ans;
}


int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = { -1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4};
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<vector<int>> ans = triplet(n, arr);
    for (auto it : ans) {
        cout << "[";
        for (auto i : it) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
        cout << "] ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(N^3*)`

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## 2-pointer approach:

### Intuition:

In this approach, we will first sort the array and use a fixed pointer along with two moving pointers to find the unique triplets. The idea is to avoid storing elements in an additional data structure while ensuring that we only get unique triplets.

After sorting the array, we will fix one pointer (let's say `i`), and use two other pointers (`j` and `k`) that will move accordingly. The key idea is to skip duplicate elements while moving the pointers to avoid considering the same triplet multiple times.

### Approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, we will sort the array to ensure that duplicates are adjacent, allowing us to easily skip them.

2. **Fix Pointer `i`**: We will use a loop (`i`) that will run from 0 to `n-1`. This loop will fix the value at `i` for every combination of the remaining two elements.

3. **Skip Duplicates for `i`**: Inside the loop, before proceeding, we will check if the current element is the same as the previous element. If they are the same, we will continue to the next index of `i` to avoid considering duplicate triplets.

4. **Use Two Moving Pointers (`j` and `k`)**: We will set pointer `j` to the element right after `i` (`i+1`) and pointer `k` to the last element. These two pointers will move toward each other. Pointer `j` will move forward (incremented), and pointer `k` will move backward (decremented) until they cross each other.

5. **Check the Sum**: At each iteration, we will check the sum of `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]`.

   - If the sum is greater than the target, we need smaller numbers, so we decrement pointer `k`.
   - If the sum is less than the target, we need larger numbers, so we increment pointer `j`.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, we have found a triplet. We will insert it into our answer.

6. **Skip Duplicates for `j` and `k`**: After finding a valid triplet, we will continue moving pointers `j` and `k`, skipping over adjacent duplicate values to ensure that we only consider unique triplets.

7. **Return the List of Unique Triplets**: After processing all possible triplets, we will have a list of unique triplets that sum to the target.

### Steps Summary:

1. Sort the array.
2. Use a loop (`i`) from 0 to `n-1` to fix one element at a time.
3. Inside the loop, skip duplicates for `i`.
4. Use two pointers `j` (starting from `i+1`) and `k` (starting from the last index).
5. Check the sum of `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]`.
6. Adjust the pointers `j` and `k` based on the sum.
7. Skip duplicates for `j` and `k` as needed.
8. Collect and return all unique triplets.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find all unique triplets without relying on any extra data structures for storing the triplets.


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> triplet(int n, vector<int> &arr) {
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //remove duplicates:
        if (i != 0 && arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) continue;

        //moving 2 pointers:
        int j = i + 1;
        int k = n - 1;
        while (j < k) {
            int sum = arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k];
            if (sum < 0) {
                j++;
            }
            else if (sum > 0) {
                k--;
            }
            else {
                vector<int> temp = {arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]};
                ans.push_back(temp);
                j++;
                k--;
                //skip the duplicates:
                while (j < k && arr[j] == arr[j - 1]) j++;
                while (j < k && arr[k] == arr[k + 1]) k--;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}


int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = { -1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4};
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<vector<int>> ans = triplet(n, arr);
    for (auto it : ans) {
        cout << "[";
        for (auto i : it) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
        cout << "] ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
